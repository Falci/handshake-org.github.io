## Linux Install Guide

The Handshake software suite consists of a full node (`hsd`) and a light
client (`hnsd`). The full node allows users to register, update, transfer,
and resolve names. Users can also make blockchain payments using `hsd`.
The light client allows users to resolve names without the computing resource
requirements of running a full node.

### `hsd`

To install `hsd`, follow the instructions
[here](https://github.com/handshake-org/hsd/blob/master/docs/install.md).

### `hnsd`

Currently, `hnsd` is not compatible with the `hsd` network protocol. Check the
[repository](https://github.com/handshake-org/hnsd) for development updates.
